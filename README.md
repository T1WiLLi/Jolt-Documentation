# **Jolt** is a lightweight Java-based web application framework.

---

Welcome to Jolt, a lightweight and powerful Java web framework designed to simplify the development of modern web applications. Jolt provides a robust set of tools and features to help you build scalable, maintainable, and high-performance applications with ease.

## A bit about Jolt
Hi ! I'm T1WiLLi, the creator of Jolt. I started working on Jolt, not because I wanted to create somethings for others, but because at the time I was actually working a lot with the Spring framework, which, I must say, is probably the best Java framework out there. However, people that know me, know that I've always loved to learn and experiment with new things. So, as I started learning Spring, I also started to wonder, how did they do this ? How did they make it so powerful ? And, I started to think, what if I could do something similar, but with a more lightweight approach ? And, that's how Jolt was born. Of course, the idea of creating a new framework was a bit scary at first, but, I was convinced that I could make something that would help me get a better understanding of how web frameworks work, and, maybe, even help others.

***And, that's exactly what I did.***

## Key Features
 - #### Simple and intuitive API for rapid development
 - #### Built-in dependency injection for better modularity
 - #### Powerful routing system for handling complex URL patterns
 - #### Support for filters for request processing
 - #### Seamless integration with external APIs and services
 - #### High concern for security and data protection
